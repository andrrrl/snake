# Ílala
## Summary
`Ílala` is a JavaScript implementation of the classic Snake game. It defines a game board with configurable dimensions and cell size, and allows the player to control a snake that moves around the board to eat food and grow. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail; or when the snake eats all the food.
